          Working with Mehmet has been an awesome experience. 
          He is highly knowledgable and always goes the extra step to make sure everything is right.

          I had worked along with Mehmet during the initial phase of our venture which needed Web development. 
          He is a committed resource who has in depth knowledge about the domain. 
          He will be an asset for any organisation!
